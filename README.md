# VulnerableAndroidApplication
Vulnerable Android Applications is a tool to learn about component level vulnerabilites within Android Applications and how to fix them. The vulnerabilites are based on four Android components which are:
* Actvity
* Service
* Broadcast Receiver
* Content Provider


This repository contains two vulnerable apps. These are a vulnerable Banking app and a vulnerable SMS messaging app. These apps work and function as real apps to help show what are the dangers of these vulnerabilites.


There are four walkthroughs, one for each component. The walkthroughs provide information about the component and its vulnerabiltiy, how to exploit the vulnerability and how to fix it. You can find these walkthoughs and how to setup the apps [here.](https://github.com/FraserGrandfield/VulnerableAndroidApplication/tree/main/Walkthroughs)
